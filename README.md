## BookCars

BookCars is a highly customizable, scalable, and cost-efficient solution for car rental businesses. Its robust feature set and open-source nature make it a sustainable choice for long-term growth in the rental industry.

BookCars integrates Stripe and PayPal [payment gateways](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars/wiki/Payment-Gateways). You can choose either to use Stripe or PayPal for payments. If [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global) isn't available in your country, simply check if [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide) is supported and use it as an alternative for smooth and secure payments.

With BookCars, you can deploy your own customizable car rental marketplace at minimal cost using the [Docker-based setup](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars/wiki/Installing-(Docker)). The platform integrates Stripe and PayPal for secure payments and can be efficiently hosted on a 1GB RAM droplet, making it an ideal choice for single or multi-supplier operations looking for a scalable and cost-effective solution. You can deploy it for under $5/month using cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets).
<!--
BookCars is free and open source. You can customize it as you want and deploy it yourself by following the [documentation](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars/wiki). If you want me to customize it and deploy it for you, contact me by email. You can find my email in my [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/aelassas). You need to be logged in to GitHub to view my email. I can deploy the platform to the cloud for you, configure your DNS, emailing, webmail and all related tasks.
-->
BookCars is designed to work with multiple suppliers. Suppliers can manage their car fleets and bookings from the admin dashboard. BookCars can also work with a single supplier and can be used as a car rental aggregator.

From the admin dashboard, admins can create and manage suppliers, cars, countries, locations, parking spots, customers, bookings and payments.

When new suppliers are created, they receive an email prompting them to create an account in order to access the admin dashboard and manage their car fleets and bookings.

Customers can sign up from the frontend or the mobile app, search for available cars based on pickup and drop-off points and time, choose a car and complete the checkout process.
